        <h1 class='Titlefont'>What is Norse Mythology?</h1><br>
        <p class='pararaphFont'>Norse mythology refers to the Scandinavian mythological framework that was upheld during and around the time of the Viking Age (c. 790- c. 1100 CE). 
            Complete with a creation myth that has the first gods slaying a giant and turning his body parts into the world, various realms spread out beneath the World Tree Yggdrasil, 
            and the eventual destruction of the known world in the Ragnar√∂k, the Nordic mythological world is both complex and comprehensive. Its polytheistic pantheon, headed by the one-eyed Odin, 
            contains a great number of different gods and goddesses who were venerated in customs integrated into the ancient Scandinavians' daily lives.
